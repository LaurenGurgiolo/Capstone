Although Austin, TX, is frequently designated as the “Music Capital of the World,” the city demonstrates a notable lack of music industry infrastructure and businesses necessary to support its abundant pool of talent. Musicians and artists from across the United States migrate to Austin to pursue careers in the music industry. Despite Austin’s reputation for high-caliber songwriters and musicians, sustaining a livelihood through music has become increasingly challenging due to rising living costs and insufficient industry support. Consequently, many musicians have been displaced to surrounding areas in search of more affordable housing, while compensation for musicians has not kept pace with the increased cost of living. 

To address this gap, Mood Sing seeks to promote Austin artists by connecting them with licensing opportunities that provide financial support. Available at https://huggingface.co/spaces/LaurenGurgiolo/Mood_Sing, the project encourages music supervisors to utilize the platform for music placement searches. Since the collapse of the traditional music industry model due to online streaming, licensing has emerged as a major means of supporting artists’ careers. By leveraging multiple AI technologies, including facial recognition and music genre classification, Mood Sing analyzes a photograph of a face to assess mood and generates playlists featuring tracks from Austin artists that correspond to the detected emotional state. The ability to search Austin music based on mood or emotion is particularly advantageous for music supervisors seeking placement opportunities. Through facial emotion detection, music supervisors receive tailored playlists of Austin artists that align with an actor’s mood, facilitating music placement suggestions for scenes.
